# Python RSA Implementation Project

This project is a Python implementation of the RSA algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Features

* RSA Key Generation (Public and Private Keys)
* Message Encryption using the Public Key
* Message Decryption using the Private Key
* Rabin-Miller primality test for robust prime number generation

## Installation

To use this tool, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HermanCS-07/python-rsa.git
